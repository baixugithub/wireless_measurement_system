In many cases, real-time monitoring and acquisition of multi-point temperature information is required. The system is designed to have multi-point wireless temperature acquisition, monitoring, processing and transmission functions.
And the wireless transmission mode is adopted, and if the software is slightly modified, the number of temperature collection nodes can be increased or decreased, and the multi-point temperature collection can be realized.
It can also have certain fault diagnosis functions for the temperature sensors of each collection and monitoring node, and reduce the requirements for the monitoring site and environment.
